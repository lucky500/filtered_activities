-list should display sorted after new item added?

-for now:
-single list
-localstorage

-switch item's labels active, inactive

-issue:
 x-when adding item to list, list refreshes w/duplicate items until webpage is refreshed

-localstorage:
[
  {
    labels: []
  },
  {
    activities: []
  }
]
